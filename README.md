# Ultimate Twitter Clone

The following project implements a full-stack Twitter clone with modern web development technologies:

- **Node.js** for runtime environment
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Next.js 13** as the React-based web framework
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Shadcn/ui** for components
- **Supabase** for authentication (OAuth) and data persistence in PostgreSQL
- **Utilities:**
  - Forms with `react-hook-form` and `zod`
  - Date formatting with `dayjs`
  - Icons with `react-icons`
  - Tailwind CSS management with `clsx`, `tailwind-merge` and `class-variance-authority`
  - Tailwind CSS formatting with `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`

## TODO (ongoing):

- Make visible when a tweet is actually a reply
- Allow changing avatar in edit-profile form
- Add local development instructions
- Advanced feed (infinite scrolling, listen for updates, personalized based on user activity, etc.)
- Finish right-sidebar (search bar, trends for you, who to follow)
- Finish other pages (explore, notifications, messages, bookmarks search and filtering)
- Advanced create-tweet options (hashtags/trends, tag users, add media, schedule tweet, add poll, etc.)
- Add email and password authentication
