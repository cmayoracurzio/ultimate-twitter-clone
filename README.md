# Ultimate Twitter Clone

The following project implements a full-stack Twitter clone with modern web development technologies:

- **Node.js** for runtime environment
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Next.js 13** as the React-based web framework
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Supabase** for authentication and data persistence in PostgreSQL
- **Utilities:**
  - Forms with `react-hook-form` and `zod`
  - Date formatting with `dayjs`
  - Modals with `@headlessui/react`
  - Tailwind CSS formatting with `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`

## TODO (ongoing):

- Improve login page
- Finish tweet-button in left-sidebar
- Handle not-found and error pages
- Tweet page and tweet options (reply, edit, delete)
- Allow changing profile avatar
- Other features (followed/followers, email and password authentication, trends/hashtags)
- right-sidebar (corporate links, search bar, trends for you, who to follow)
- Other pages (explore, notifications, messages)
- tweet-feed with state management and infinite scrolling using [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/)
- Consider using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components
